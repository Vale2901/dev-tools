### Requirements

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### Usage

1. Update the `hostPath` property in all `configs/**/kind.yaml` files to match the path of the project on your filesystem
1. (optional) Update the `hostPort` property in all `configs/**/kind.yaml` files to the port that suits you the best to access portainer instance. Default ports are, by context:
  * base: 9010
  * ingress: 9020
  * multi-master: 9030
  * taints: 9040
  * agent: 9050
  * edge-agent: 9060
2. Create the cluster with `./setup.sh create <ENV>` where `<ENV>` is the name of the subfolder inside `configs` folder
3. Start Portainer in development mode via `yarn start`
4. Deploy or force an update of any existing Portainer app: `./setup.sh portainer <ENV>`

Open browser at `localhost:<hostPort>` (`hostPort` is defined in `kind.yaml` file, default values listed above)

##### Notes
* Multiple clusters can run at the same time, updating portainer frontend will update all running clusters (for backend you need to use step 4 to redeploy on every cluster you want)
* `setup.sh` script provides some commands to help you recreate / redeploy / delete clusters. See them with `./setup help` or `./setup.sh usage`
  * If you are on Windows and `./setup help` gives you `-bash: ./setup.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`, then run `sed -i -e 's/\r$//' setup.sh`. Playing around with Windows & Unix line endings sometimes makes bash wonder and refuse to run the script. 
* kubernetes context for all the provided configs is `kind-<CONTEXT>` (e.g. `kind-base` for `base` folder, `kind-ingress` for `ingress` folder, etc)
* You can deploy applications located inside the `applications` folder inside any kind environment with `./setup.sh deploy <CONTEXT> applications/<APP.YAML>` where `<CONTEXT>` is the application context (see above) and `<APP.YAML>` is your application yaml file inside `applications` folder
* You don't need to recreate the cluster everytime you boot ; clusters are respawned on machine boot. You may want to redeploy Portainer everytime you do a fresh build to clear all previous deployment data.


##### Applications
* Enable metrics server in an environment: `./setup.sh deploy <ENV> applications/metric-server.yaml`
* Deploy a naked pod in an environment: `./setup.sh deploy <ENV> applications/pod.yaml`
