# dev-tools

This repo shows how to run various platforms with Portainer. Initially, we use it for testing specific kube features with different kubernetes distros and exact versions. 

In this guide, we describe instructions for running:
- [Kind](kubernetes/kind) 
- [Minikube](kubernetes/minikube)

Each platform is structured as folder and has corresponding README.md.
